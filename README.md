## ‚ú® Features

This project is a seed for building a production-ready **Node.js** API with:

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe code with modern JavaScript features
- **Clean Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns with domain-driven design
- **API Documentation** - Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Authentication** - Ready-to-use auth system with email verification and password reset
- **Database Integration** - SQL support with TypeORM
- **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test setup for unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
- **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability detection with Snyk

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a clean, layered architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

### Domain Layer
Located in `/src/domain/`, this layer contains:
- **Entities**: Core business objects like **User** and **Organization**
- **Migrations**: Database schema migrations
- **Mappers**: Object mapping service (e.g., Automapper or a custom mapping utility)

### Application Layer
Located in `/src/application/`, organized by feature modules. Each module follows a consistent structure with:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses using TSOA decorators
- **Services**: Contain business logic and orchestrate repository calls
- **Repositories**: Handle data access, using TypeORM for CRUD operations
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects, used for input validation and response formatting (separate from domain entities)

### Infrastructure Layer
Located in `/src/infrastructure/`, this contains:
- **Config**:
  - `authConfig`: Authentication-related configs for better-auth
  - `DbConnection`: Database connection setup
  - `Constants`: Configuration constants
  - `Server`: Main server setup (Express + TSOA integration)
  - **IoC Container**: Dependency injection container setup using TSyringe
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and adapters
  - `Authentication`: Express Authentication middleware
  - `BetterAdapter`: Integration with the **better-auth** authentication service
  - `EmailAdapter`: Integration with the email service
  - `Mapper`: Object mapping service (e.g., Automapper or a custom mapping utility)
  - `Logger`: Logging utility
  - `ErrorHandler`: Central error handling middleware

### Tests
Located in `/tests/` folder, organized as:
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Isolate a single service or component, mocking out dependencies (using `ts-mockito` or Sinon)
  - Verify correct behavior via assertions
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test multiple layers together (controllers, services, repositories)
  - Commonly used to test API endpoints end-to-end
- **Persistence Tests**:
  - Specifically focus on database interactions, entity mappings, and queries

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.x or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/base.api.git
   cd base.api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Create environment files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/infrastructure/config/env
   cp .env.example src/infrastructure/config/env/.env.local
   ```

2. Update the environment variables in `.env.local` with your configuration

## üíª Development

### Available Commands

- **Installation:** `yarn install` - Download dependencies
- **Development:** `yarn dev` - Start the server in development mode
- **Local Development:** `yarn local` - Start with nodemon for auto-reloading
- **Build:** `yarn build` - Create production build
- **Testing:** `yarn test` - Run unit and integration tests
- **Linting:** `yarn lint` - Check code style
- **Type Checking:** `yarn type-check` - Verify TypeScript types

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, access the Swagger documentation at:
- `http://localhost:3000/docs` (replace with your configured port)

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test strategy with unit, integration, and persistence tests:

### Testing Tools
- **Mocha**: Test runner
- **Supertest**: For API testing
- **Chai**: Assertion library
- **ts-mockito** and **sinon**: Mocking libraries

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the interaction between multiple components
   - Verify that different parts of the system work together
   - Often involve testing API endpoints end-to-end

3. **Persistence Tests**
   - Focus on database interactions
   - Verify entity mappings and relationships
   - Test complex queries and transactions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run specific test file
yarn test:file tests/path/to/test.spec.ts

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage
```

### Test Approach
1. Read the service or component under test
2. Identify one scenario to test
3. Create the test for that scenario and run it
4. If it fails, understand and fix the test (or code) and run again
5. If it passes, create another test
6. Continue iteratively until minimal coverage is achieved

## üîÑ CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`.

#### Workflow Summary:
* **Build and Test Job:**
  * Sets up Node.js environment
  * Installs dependencies
  * Creates test environment configuration
  * Builds the application
  * Runs linting checks
  * Executes tests (unit and integration)
  * Uploads test coverage reports to Codecov

* **Security Scan Job:**
  * Runs Snyk security scan to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies
  * Configured to flag high severity issues

#### Required Secrets:
To use all features of the workflow, set up the following GitHub secrets:
* `RESEND_API_KEY` - API key for the Resend email service
* `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` - Default sender email address
* `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Token for uploading coverage reports to Codecov (optional)
* `SNYK_TOKEN` - Token for Snyk security scanning (optional)

## üåê Deployment

For deployment to AWS or other cloud providers, additional workflow jobs can be added to:
* Create Docker images
* Push to container registries (ECR, Docker Hub, etc.)
* Deploy to hosting environments (ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, etc.)
